# webforge-project-stack

Full stack for webforge components to write a webapplication or website.

## Why is it called that way?

Often you talk about an application stack as the components that are loaded to transform a request to an response with your kernel. This is exactly what this stack is doing. It's called project stack because a project is needed to get started. A Webforge\Framework\Project is a decorated Webforge\Framework\Package\Package.

## getting started

Instantiate the Webforge\ProjectStack\Container with an object instance of Webforge\Framework\Project

Have a look at the container api to get your component instances containers (services).
